# Sensomat

***Sensomat*** is a full-stack web application consisting of a Vue.js single-page frontend and a Laravel backend with a MySQL database, developed as part of my bachelor‚Äôs thesis. The goal of the thesis was to examine how business processes related to the operation and stocking of cigarette vending machines can be optimized through software support. In this context, the application was designed and implemented to provide centralized inventory management and status monitoring. The project also explored which technical and functional requirements such a system must fulfill to support vending machine operators effectively and ensure smooth, transparent supervision of machine performance and stock levels.


## Technologies

## Architecture

The application follows a classic three-tier architecture consisting of a Vue.js frontend, a Laravel backend, and a MySQL database.

- **Vue.js Client**: The frontend is a single-page application built with Vue.js. It uses Vue Router for client-side routing and Axios for communication with the backend.
- **Laravel Backend**: The backend exposes a RESTful API and follows the MVC pattern to process requests and interact with the database.
- **MySQL Database**: The application stores its data in a relational MySQL database, which is queried and modified by the Laravel backend.

Communication between frontend and backend is handled via HTTP requests and JSON responses. The backend translates these into SQL queries for data persistence and retrieval.

## API Overview

The backend provides a RESTful API built with Laravel. It exposes multiple endpoints to manage products, vending machines, product types, and authentication. The API follows common REST conventions using `apiResource` routes where applicable, and is designed for structured, programmatic access.
